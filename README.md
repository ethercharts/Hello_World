# Hello_World

Ether Charts is a small community driven web project for all of us who wish to use the Etherdelta exchange but desire a higher level of analitics compaired to using the default candle sticks offerd by Etherdelta.
To accomplish this I plan on using the free html5 stock charting library offered by tradingview.com and the API from etherdelta.github.io
